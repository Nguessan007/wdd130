          <p>Ivory Coast is a country located in West Africa. It is bordered by Mali and Burkina Faso to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south, Ghana to the east and Liberia to the west. It's a country where it's good to live with joy and good mood. It has a great role in this part of area regarding his location in the field of trade especially, in the tourism because of his important and healthy cultures and traditions, and above all it's by his hospitality. This is the country that saw me born and grow up and I'm really proud !!</p>
