           <p>Hello! My name is Prince N'guessan and I am from Abidjan, Ivory Coast. I love web development, outdoor adventures, and learning new technologies. As a guy passionated with video games, i decided to take this journey to be a software developer to bring innovation in the society in creation of websites and app, and video games too. I got 4 siblings and I'm the third child. In my free time, I like to play basketball, play video games, watch movies, anime and animations. Like I said before I'm originally from Ivory Coast and I recently moved in Utah a year ago to fulfill my dream. For me it looks like a great adventure that I'm about to live and feel. I know that the path is going to be long but sure as long as I stay focus on the Lord and I try to do my best to obey his commandments, I will receive the blessings. Every day is a blessing for me and an opportunity to be better.</p>

          <p>Ivory Coast is a country located in West Africa. It is bordered by Mali and Burkina Faso to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south, Ghana to the east and Liberia to the west. It's a country where it's good to live with joy and good mood. It has a great role in this part of area regarding his location in the field of trade especially, in the tourism because of his important and healthy cultures and traditions, and above all it's by his hospitality. This is the country that saw me born and grow up and I'm really proud !!</p>
